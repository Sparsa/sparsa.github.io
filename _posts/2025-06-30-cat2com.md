**Category Theory, Abstraction, and Computer Science**

I am by training a computer scientist. One of the things I find most fascinating about computer science is its reliance on layers of abstraction. Much of what we do with computers is built upon carefully hidden complexity. When you run a word processor, for instance, you simply tap an icon, and a window appears. You interact with menus, buttons, and icons, rarely stopping to consider what lies beneath.

But behind that user interface are pixels—just colored dots on a screen—that visually represent program logic. That logic is itself encoded in software: programs that appear to us as applications, but are in fact binary sequences of 0s and 1s. These sequences are not arbitrary; they carry meaning specific to the architecture of the computer on which they run. Whether it’s a laptop, a smartphone, or a server, each interprets that binary differently, but all follow the same principle: abstraction.

Even at this level, abstraction has already begun. We often forget that computers are fundamentally electronic machines. They operate through electric flows, with binary digits representing the **ON** and **OFF** states of electric current. These states correspond to the physical behavior of transistors—tiny switches that form the foundation of all computing hardware. A computer program, then, is ultimately just a highly structured set of instructions that controls the ON/OFF patterns of billions of switches, based on inputs like keyboard strokes and mouse clicks.

But this begs a deeper question: How can such mechanical switching give rise to something as sophisticated as a word processor—or even a programming language?

To answer that, we must go back almost a century, to a time when mathematicians began asking a profound question:

**Can all problems be solved algorithmically?**

Surprisingly, the answer is  **no** .

But while the answer itself is sobering, the journey that led to this conclusion is full of rich ideas—and it is here that abstraction reaches one of its highest forms.

To be continued...
