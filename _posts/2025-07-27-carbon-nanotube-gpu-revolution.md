The landscape of computing is on the verge of a fundamental transformation. Recent breakthroughs in carbon nanotube (CNT) computing have moved beyond the realm of theoretical possibility into practical demonstrations, potentially reshaping the $100B+ GPU industry that powers everything from gaming to AI. As someone who once was fascinated by this new emerging field [^slide], I wanted to dig in to more details after a decade and see how things progressed so far. And I am more hopeful now than ever that soon we will be using a complete processor made out of carbon nanotubes[^cntgrowth;^ctnai;^cntmore;^cntmarket,^cnttensor].

### The Silicon Ceiling: Why Change is Inevitable

The GPU industry is experiencing explosive growth, projected to reach $461B by 2032, driven by AI workloads and data center demand[^cntai;^cntai2]. But this growth is also running up against fundamental challenges:
	•	Modern GPUs, such as the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 590, consume up to 365W.
	•	Advanced data center GPUs can use significantly more power, posing severe energy and thermal constraints.
	•	The silicon transistor, cornerstone of traditional GPUs, is approaching the limits of miniaturization.

### The Carbon Nanotube Breakthrough: From Lab to Reality

The most significant development arrived in 2024, when researchers demonstrated a processing unit using only carbon nanotube transistors. This CNT-based processing unit contained 3,000 CNT field-effect transistors, arranged in a 3×3 matrix. Tested on image processing, it achieved 88% accuracy while consuming only 295 microwatts! An unprecedented 1 trillion operations per watt.
		To put this in perspective, Google's silicon-based TPU needs 2W per 4 trillion operations, making the CNT version about 1,700 times more energy efficient.

### Performance Advantages: Beyond Energy Efficiency

CNT computing offers more than energy savings:
	•	Current densities: University of Wisconsin-Madison found CNT transistors can reach nearly double the current densities of advanced silicon ones, and do so at lower voltages.
	•	Scalability: MIT researchers have built CNT microprocessors with over 14,000 transistors.
	•	Stanford University demonstrated up to ten times energy efficiency over silicon in real circuits.
### Manufacturing Breakthroughs: Overcoming Historical Challenges
For years, commercialization stalled due to manufacturing hurdles:
	•	Traditional CNTs were riddled with metallic impurities, lowering circuit reliability.
	•	Precise placement and alignment were difficult.
### Recent advances resolved key issues:
	•	Purity & Alignment: Semiconducting purity now reaches 99.9999%. New methods allow for precise positioning of individual nanotubes.
	•	AI-Driven Production: Machine learning-enhanced platforms like CARCO have slashed CNT growth optimization times from years to weeks.
	•	Mass Production: IBM and others have shown how CNTs can be integrated into existing semiconductor fabs.
### Impact on GPU Architecture and AI Computing
Practical CNT computing could reshape GPU architecture in crucial ways:
	•	Specialized AI Processors: CNT-based tensor units point towards ultra-efficient AI acceleration.
	•	Thermal Management: CNTs have exceptional thermal properties, allowing denser chips without overheating.
	•	Beyond Silicon Scaling: CNTs offer a path to continued performance growth as silicon scaling slows.
